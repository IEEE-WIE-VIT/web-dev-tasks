It is a web app created using HTML5,CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript that enables the user to search for a city and render its weather.
I have used the Vanilla Javascript for the first time and it's quite interesting.Still a long way to go.
In the process,I've learned how to make the app fully Responsive;I got to know what AJAX techniques are.
