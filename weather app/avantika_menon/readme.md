As i did this task I learnt a lot of new things-
I implemented bootstrap for the first time for the format of the wepage.
To use the API I used a little bit of ajax.
The css I used for the effects of rain and thunder were completely new for me and I found the codes online and implemented them.
I learnt about the function linear-gradient which i really enjoyed using to transition the different times of the day.
